# mastering-vuex

The start of this codebase is a copy of what we finished with from 
the course ['Real World Vue'](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/real-world-intro).

For the code to work, we need to run a server to host the db.json file 
so we can make API calls to fetch the data from the file.

## Run JSON server
In the course, we used json-server to do this. 
1. Install the package: `npm install -g json-server`
2. Run the server: `json-server --watch db.json`


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
